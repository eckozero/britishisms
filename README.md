Britishisms
===========

Chrome extension amending American-English words to British-English words.

This is an extension for a bit of fun, not to say that American English is 
*incorrect* (they are, after all, **different languages**).


Installation
------------

Alternatively, drag `Britishisms.crx` onto `chrome://extensions`, which
you can open via Window > Extensions.


Forked Code
