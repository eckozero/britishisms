Britishisms
===========

Chrome extension amending American-English words to British-English words.

This is an extension for a bit of fun, not to say that American English is 
*incorrect* (they are, after all, **different languages**).


Installation
------------

To build the CRX, open the Chrome extensions tab (type: `chrome://extensions` 
into the address bar) and check developer options.

Click on `Pack Extension..` and navigate to the src directory of the git 
repo. This will build a `src.crx` into the `britishisms` directory.

You can then drag and drop the crx file onto the extensions tab and it will 
add it to your extensions.

Alternatively if you trust the build, you can drag the existing 
`Britishisms.crx` into the `chrome://extensions` tab.
